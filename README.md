# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

the objective:
im trying to add a new object to the bills array of objects in expensesSlice.js file 
im using redux toolkit and tryiing to update state as if immer library didnt exsit. so old fashion immutable updates copying the original
bills array and added a nerw obj to it with a new name: 'some name and cost: "$$$" values 

the problem 
is i tryed to added a updated to my store within my AddItem.js compnent its giving me the error bills is not iterable which is not true 
if i remove the AddItem.js component the eroor goes away and i can iterate over it and put it values back in ListExpenses.js without problem.

my guess
is somthing is wrong with the way im eihter dispatching or how im updateing the state in epensesSlice.js not sure why this isnt working prioperly # expenses-tracker
